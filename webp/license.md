Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents) 
------------------------------------ 
 
"These implementations" means the copyrightable works that implement the WebM 
codecs distributed by Google as part of the WebM Project. 

Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to 
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise 
run, modify and propagate the contents of these implementations of WebM, where 
 such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned by 
Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily 
infringed by these implementations of WebM. This grant does not include claims 
 that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of these 
implementations. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order 
or agree to the institution of patent litigation or any other patent 
 enforcement activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of these implementations of WebM 
or any code incorporated within any of these implementations of WebM 
constitute direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of 
 patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License 
for these implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation is filed.
